## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub repository! Iâ€™m an MLOps engineer focused on the end-to-end lifecycle of machine learning modelsâ€”particularly deployment, monitoring, and operationalization. This space is dedicated to sharing projects, tools, and practices that bridge the gap between data science and production-ready ML systems.

My work involves taking trained models and turning them into scalable, reliable services. I focus on building deployment pipelines, containerizing models, setting up RESTful APIs, and integrating with cloud infrastructure to ensure that machine learning solutions can deliver real value in real-world environments.

Beyond deployment, Iâ€™m especially interested in monitoring model performance over timeâ€”tracking metrics like drift, latency, throughput, and accuracy in production. I believe monitoring is a critical part of the MLOps process, ensuring that models stay reliable, fair, and effective long after theyâ€™re deployed.

This repository includes code samples, experiments, and templates for deploying models using tools like Docker, FastAPI, TensorFlow Serving, TorchServe, and Kubernetes, along with monitoring setups using Prometheus, Grafana, and custom logging. I also explore CI/CD workflows, infrastructure as code, and best practices for maintaining reproducibility and scalability in machine learning pipelines.

Whether youâ€™re a data scientist looking to move models into production, or an engineer exploring MLOps for the first time, feel free to explore the code, contribute, or reach out. Iâ€™m always learning and open to collaborating on better ways to ship and maintain machine learning systems.

Thanks for visiting! I hope this repository provides insights, tools, or inspiration for your own journey in deploying and monitoring ML models at scale.
